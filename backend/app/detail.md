How do you know if it's inserted correctly:

1. Run your finger around the side of the cup in a full circle to make sure there is no indentation, and the cup is open.

2. If it is indented, pinch the base of the cup (not the stem) and move it gently until it fully opens.

It may take 2 or 3 period cycles until you are comfortable inserting and removing the cup.

Wash hands with soap and water when you're finished inserting, checking the position of, or removing the cup.

How to remove and empty the Could You? Cup between uses:

The cup can remain in your body for up to 12 hours - empty your cup every 4 to 12 hours, depending on your menstrual flow.

1. Wash your hands with soap and water.

2. Sit or squat with your legs apart (or put one leg up on a chair or the toilet.) Push down with your stomach muscles. Using your thumb and two fingers feel inside your vagina for the base of your cup. Squeeze the base to allow the cup to detach from the walls of the vagina or insert a finger alongside the cup. If you cannot feel the cup, breathe and push down with your inner muscles.

3. Do not pull the stem. Place your fingers at the base of the cup, above the stem and gently and slowly pull the cup out. It is normal for the cup to make a slight noise when you remove it. When the base of the cup is almost out, use your finger to push the cup on one side to remove half of the rim then the other half will come out easily. This ensures the cup slides out while remaining upright to avoid spilling the contents.

4. Empty the cup into a toilet. Wash the cup with clean water or wipe it with tissue. DO NOT use soap. If you are near a sink, you can rinse out the cup and re-insert. If you are not near a sink, you can re-insert without rinsing as it has your own body fluids on it.

5. Fold the cup as before and insert it back into your vagina.



How to clean and store your CouldYou? Cup:

Do not use soap or bleach on your menstrual cup because it will cause irritation inside your vagina.

1. Wash the cup with water.

2. Place the cup in a pot/container of water and boil for 5 minutes, making sure the water covers the cup. Do not let the water boil dry, as the pan will burn the cup.

3. Remove it from the water. Let it air dry (it will dry very quickly).

4. Place the cup in the cotton storage bag that was provided with the cup. This allows it to breathe. Keep it there until you need it next month. Do not store it in an airtight or plastic bag/box.

Cup you can do all your regular activities (school, sports, swimming, dancing!) For a video on how to insert the Could You? Cup go to www.couldyoucup.org/resources/ Girls around the world often have limited options for feminine hygiene products and may have to use "traditional" methods such as cloths, papers or leaves, which can be uncomfortable, unhealthy and allow leakage onto clothes. These challenges lead to more serious issues such as reproductive diseases caused by poor menstrual hygiene, and contribute to school absenteeism.
Facilities such as separate women's or private bathrooms-or those with running water and soap-often do not exist, making it challenging for girls to change sanitary products and wash.
689 million people live in extreme poverty on $1.90 or less a day, according

1 in 5 girls in the USA have missed school due to menstruation
Girls not completing school costs countries $15-30 trillion in lost lifetime productivity & earnings (according to World Bank)
According to the United Nations Children's Fund, one in ten African girls do not attend school during menstruation. In addition, girls may refrain from participating in physical activities and have a lower level of confidence.

Frequently Asked Questions
How long can I wear the cup?
Up to 12 hours. Empty every 4 to 12 hours according to the heaviness of your menstrual flow.
Will I still be a virgin if I use the cup? Will the cup affect my hymen?
YES! Virgins may absolutely use the cup. The hymen is a thin membrane at the entrance of the vagina. When a girl reaches puberty the hymen becomes more elastic. The hymen has spaces that allow menstrual blood to flow through it. Therefore it is safe to use the Could You? Cup for girls whose hymen is still intact. The hymen can be broken in childhood, from a fall, while playing sports or activities, and with sexual intercourse. A broken hymen does not mean a girl is.no longer a virgin; a girl stops being a virgin once she has sexual intercourse. http://womena.dk/do-menstrual-cups-affect-hymens-
virginity/
What if there are no sinks near me? Do I need to rinse it? No problem! If you are WITHOUT WATER...empty the cup carefully in the toilet (or latrine), taking care not to drop it on the floor. Immediately insert it again. The cup is made from a very safe material, which does not let bacteria grow. There is no need to wash your cup each time you empty it as the vagina has its own self-cleansing system. It is safe to re-insert without washing and this reduces the risk of dropping it or getting it dirty. Wash your hands after reinserting. Only rinse it if you have clean water.
What do I do if I drop my cup?
If the cup falls on a clean surface, it can be rinsed with clean water and re-inserted. If it falls onto a dirty floor or into a latrine it must not be used again until it has been boiled for to kill any bacteria.

What if the stem of the cup is uncomfortable?
The CouldYou? Cup is made with a stem to make it easier to remove. The stem is used to locate the cup. Do not use the stem to remove the cup. If it is uncomfortable or sticking out too much, you can cut the stem using scissors or a knife. Cut only a little bit at a time to see if this makes it more comfortable to wear. Be careful not to cut a hole in the cup! Follow the instructions noted in the section "How to remove and empty the Could You? Cup between uses".
I have really heavy periods, can the cup handle this? Yes. Each cup holds 20-25 milliliters of blood. The cup can collect up to 3 times more menstrual blood than sanitary pads and 5 times as much as tampons. During the first months of use, empty the cup every 3 to 4 hours to get familiar with your flow. Leaking can occur if you have a heavy period so you might need to empty it more frequently. With continued use, you will get to know your body and how often you need to empty the cup.
Is it ok to use the cup with a light flow?
Yes. The cup is perfect for light flow, as it collects your menstrual flow without drying the vaginal walls. This means that removal will be less frequent than during the heavy days of your period. It is safe to keep the menstrual cup in for up to 12 hours.
Should I remove the cup to urinate/defecate?
The cup stays inside when you urinate or defecate; as urine and feces come from different openings. You do not have to remove your cup to urinate. Sometimes when you defecate the cup falls out of place. If this happens, remove it and insert it again.
Is it safe to wear the cup at night?
Yes. The cup is safe to wear at night. Make sure it is empty before going to bed and empty it when you wake up.

What if I forget to take out my cup?
Remove it as soon as you remember. It is easy to forget your cup because it is comfortable and the menstrual blood does not come into contact with air so it does not smell. You can put the cup in the day before you expect your period will start.
What if I cannot remove the cup?
Relax, and do not worry. Walk around and try again. Jumping or gravity may help. Try sitting or squatting in a different position.
Can the cup cause vaginal infections?
No. The vagina has protective secretions that maintain the correct balance (pH) and also help prevent infections. Cups do not absorb these secretions, so the vagina remains healthy during your periods. Using soap on the cup can upset the pH balance of your vagina, so use only clean water.
What is Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) also known as Menstrual Toxic Shock Syndrome (mTSS)?
Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is a rare event that occurs among menstruating girls and women. The symptoms are high fever, flu-like symptoms, dizziness, which can lead to severe illness, coma, and even death. About 3 per 100,000 tampon users suffered from TSS in the 1980s when they used highly absorbent tampons. Since then, only 5 suspected cases of TSS have been reported among many millions of cup users. Two of these women also used a contraceptive coil, and one had auto-immune disease. TSS is very rare, but be aware of the symptoms. If they occur, immediately remove the cup and seek medical advice.

increase-risk-toxic-shock-syndrome/
Can I share my cup with a friend or my sister?
No, it is for your personal use and must not be shared with anyone else.

Can the cup get lost inside me?
No, the cup can NOT get lost inside your body! You can use your own vaginal muscles to help lower the cup. Make small downward pushes with your vaginal muscles until the cup shifts and you can reach it. Relax, take your time, and your vaginal muscles will relax making it easier to remove.
Can you use a cup when also using a contraceptive IUD (intra-uterine device for birth control)?
Yes you can but before doing so, ask your healthcare professional/doctor.

What is the environmental impact of menstrual cups? The environmental impact of a reusable menstrual cup is less than 1.5% of the impact of pads or tampons
What is the difference between cheap and
expensive cups?
Some brands of cheap cups are not made from medical grade silicone but from poor quality plastic. They may be stiff to fold and insert easily; or too soft and leak. They may not last very long. The Could You Cup is a high quality
menstrual cup.
